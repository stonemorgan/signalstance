# Changelog

All notable changes to Signal & Stance are documented here.

## [Unreleased]

## [1.11.0] - 2026-03-15

### Added
- **`/api/config` endpoint** — serves a safe subset of `business_config.json` to the frontend (app name, owner, platform, content categories, schedule timezone, feed categories). No API keys or scoring internals are exposed.
- **`loadConfig()` / `applyConfig()`** — async config loader in the frontend with try/catch fallback to hardcoded defaults so the app still works if the endpoint fails.
- **`selectCategory(key)`** — centralized category selection function replacing 5 duplicated `categoryBtns.forEach(...)` patterns across the codebase.
- **`renderCategoryButtons()`** — generates category buttons dynamically from `content.categories` config, preserving existing CSS classes and click behavior.
- **`renderFeedCategoryDropdowns()`** — populates all `.feed-category-select` dropdowns (article filter and add-feed form) from `feeds.categories` config, preserving the "All categories" first option on the filter.
- **`getCategoryDisplayName(key)`** — converts category keys to display names (e.g., `executive_careers` → "Executive Careers"), replacing the hardcoded `feedCatLabels` map.

### Changed
- **6 hardcoded "LinkedIn" references** in scheduling UI, copy-and-schedule flow, unschedule reminder, paste hint, and `window.open` URL now read from `APP_CONFIG.platform.name` and `APP_CONFIG.platform.scheduling_url` with `|| 'LinkedIn'` fallbacks.
- **3 hardcoded "EST" references** in calendar time displays (published, scheduled, suggested) now read from `APP_CONFIG.schedule.timezone`.
- **Category buttons** in the Create tab are no longer hardcoded HTML — generated dynamically from config on page load.
- **Feed category dropdowns** (article filter and add-feed form) are no longer hardcoded `<option>` elements — populated from config on page load.
- **`formatCategory()`** now checks `APP_CONFIG.content.categories` first for display labels, falling back to a static map only for internal categories (autopilot, url_react, feed_react).
- **`contentTypeToCat` mapping** documented as config-dependent with a comment explaining its relationship to `business_config.json` content types and categories.
- **`app.py`** imports `BUSINESS` from `business_config` alongside `APP_NAME`.

### Removed
- **`feedCatLabels` hardcoded map** — replaced by dynamic `getCategoryDisplayName()`.
- **`categoryBtns` static NodeList** — removed; all category selection now uses `selectCategory()` with live DOM queries.

## [1.10.0] - 2026-03-15

### Added
- **Prompt template engine** — `load_prompt()` in `engine.py` now performs `{{key.subkey}}` placeholder substitution using a flattened version of `business_config.json`. Template variables like `{{owner.name}}`, `{{platform.name}}`, `{{owner.audience}}` are resolved automatically at load time.
- **`_flatten_config()`** helper that converts the nested config dict into dot-notation keys (e.g., `owner.name`, `content.default_ctas.tips`). List values are auto-joined as comma-separated strings.
- **`<!-- AUTHORED SECTION -->`** and **`<!-- TEMPLATED -->`** documentation markers in all 11 prompt files. Authored sections contain domain-specific voice rules, examples, and content arcs that must be manually rewritten per business. Templated sections are auto-filled from config.
- **Template verification tests** in `test_engine.py` and `test_carousel.py` — load all 11 prompt files via `load_prompt()` and assert zero unresolved `{{}}` placeholders remain.

### Changed
- **`prompts/base_system.md`** — identity paragraph, credentials block, platform references, and audience references in the self-evaluation checklist are now template variables. Voice rules, signature language, hard rules, and example hooks remain as authored content.
- **`prompts/category_pattern.md`**, **`category_faq.md`**, **`category_noticed.md`**, **`category_hottake.md`** — all owner name references replaced with `{{owner.name}}`; platform references with `{{platform.name}}`. Content arcs, example hooks, and tone descriptions remain as authored content.
- **`prompts/autopilot.md`** — owner name, audience, niche summary, and expertise references templatized. Search topics and category mapping remain as authored content.
- **`prompts/url_react.md`** and **`feed_react.md`** — owner name, platform, audience, and niche references templatized. Reaction approaches and feed category calibration remain as authored content.
- **`prompts/carousel_tips.md`**, **`carousel_beforeafter.md`**, **`carousel_mythreality.md`** — owner name and platform references templatized. Content rules and example outputs remain as authored content.

## [1.9.0] - 2026-03-15

### Added
- **`business_config.json`** — single source of truth for all business identity, brand colors, typography, content schedule, posting times, feed categories, scoring criteria, default CTAs, and platform settings. Changing the business owner, brand, schedule, or domain is now a single-file edit.
- **`business_config.py`** — loader module that reads `business_config.json` at import time and exposes convenience accessors (`OWNER`, `PLATFORM`, `BRAND_COLORS`, `CONTENT`, `SCHEDULE`, `FEEDS_CONFIG`, `SCORING`, `APP_NAME`). Includes `{section.key}` template interpolation for scoring strings.

### Changed
- **`brand.py`** now reads all colors, fonts, author identity, and slide dimensions from `business_config.json` instead of hardcoding them. The `BRAND` dict structure is preserved — no downstream changes needed.
- **`config.py`** now reads `CONTENT_SCHEDULE`, `SUGGESTED_TIMES`, and `DATABASE_PATH` from `business_config.json`. Integer keys (0=Monday through 4=Friday) are preserved for backward compatibility. `ANTHROPIC_MODEL`, `MAX_TOKENS`, and `FLASK_PORT` are now overridable via environment variables.
- **`feeds.py`** — `FEED_CATEGORIES` dict now reads from `business_config.json`. `DEFAULT_FEEDS` list remains in this file.
- **`feed_scanner.py`** — scoring system prompt is now built dynamically from `business_config.json` owner identity and scoring criteria instead of a hardcoded paragraph.
- **`engine.py`** — replaced 8 hardcoded business-specific strings with config reads: autopilot topic description, URL/feed reaction messages, default relevance reason, and 3 CTA defaults.
- **`app.py`** — app name read from config and passed to the template via `app_name` variable; fallback string uses config.
- **`templates/index.html`** — 3 hardcoded "Signal & Stance" references replaced with `{{ app_name }}` Jinja2 variable.
- **`carousel_renderer.py`** — default CTA fallback now reads from `business_config.json` instead of a hardcoded string.

## [1.8.0] - 2026-03-13

### Added
- **Carousel output format in UI** — "Output: Text Post / Carousel" radio toggle in the Create tab between the textarea and Generate button. Selecting "Carousel" reveals a template picker with three options (Numbered Tips, Before/After, Myth vs Reality) and changes the button text to "Generate Carousel"
- **Carousel results display** — carousel-specific result card showing title, template type, slide count, horizontal slide preview strip (Cover, Tip 1, Tip 2..., CTA boxes), full slide content details, "Download PDF" button, "Regenerate Content" button, and "Add to Calendar" button
- **Carousel history integration** — carousel entries in the History section display a "Carousel" tag alongside the category tag, show the carousel title and slide count instead of draft text, and include a "Download PDF" link when the file still exists
- **`POST /api/generate/carousel`** — main carousel generation endpoint. Validates category, raw_input, and template_type; saves insight; calls `generate_carousel_content()` + `render_carousel()`; saves generation and carousel metadata; returns carousel info with download URL and slide previews
- **`GET /api/carousel/download/<generation_id>`** — serves the generated PDF file for download, returns 404 if carousel data or file doesn't exist
- **`POST /api/generate/carousel/regenerate`** — regenerates carousel content from the same insight with new API call, renders new PDF, returns updated carousel data
- **`carousel_data` database table** — stores carousel metadata (generation_id FK, template_type, parsed_content as JSON, pdf_filename, slide_count)
- **`save_carousel_data()`** and **`get_carousel_data()`** database functions
- **`cleanup_old_carousels(days=30)`** — runs on app startup, deletes PDF files older than 30 days from `generated_carousels/`
- **`generated_carousels/` directory** created automatically on app startup
- History API (`GET /api/history`) now enriches responses with carousel metadata including template type, slide count, download URL, and file existence check

### Changed
- `GET /api/history` response now includes a `carousel` object on drafts that are carousels, with `template_type`, `slide_count`, `title`, `pdf_url`, and `file_exists` fields
- Generate button text dynamically updates: "Generate Drafts" (text), "Generate Carousel" (carousel), or "Generate Reaction" (URL)
- Results section heading switches between "Your Drafts" and "Your Carousel" based on output type
- Regenerate button hidden for carousel results (carousel card has its own "Regenerate Content" button)

### Added
- **PDF carousel renderer** — generates branded 1080×1080 multi-page PDF carousels from structured content produced by the carousel content engine

- CTA slide renderer — author credentials block, teal rounded CTA box, LinkedIn URL
- `draw_wrapped_text()` helper using ReportLab Paragraph + Frame for proper text wrapping with XML escaping
- `draw_footer()` and `draw_accent_line()` shared decorators across content slides
- All colors and fonts sourced from `brand.py` for consistency

- `CAROUSEL_PROMPT_MAP` dict mapping template types to prompt file paths
- `test_carousel.py` — test script validating all 3 templates with realistic inputs, content rules, and parsing reliability

## [1.5.0] - 2026-03-13

### Added
- **Feed tab** — third tab in the UI (`[ Create ] [ Calendar ] [ Feed ]`) for browsing and acting on curated RSS articles directly in the browser
- **Article feed view** — scrollable list of article cards showing title (clickable, opens source URL), feed name, category tag, relative time, truncated summary, relevance score badge (green/amber/gray), and relevance reason
- **"Generate Post From This" button** on each article card — generates 3 drafts from the article, switches to the Create tab, and displays source info (article title, feed name, relevance score) above the drafts
- **"Dismiss" button** on each article card — removes the article with a smooth fade-out animation, no confirmation needed
- **Feed controls** — "Last refreshed" timestamp with "Refresh Feeds" button, category filter dropdown (10 categories), "High relevance only" checkbox, and live article count

- **Feed management view** — accessible via "Manage Feeds" link; shows all feeds with enable/disable toggle, name, category tag, URL, last fetched time, article count, error status, and remove button with confirmation
- **Add feed form** — inline form with URL, Name, and Category dropdown; immediately fetches the feed on add and shows success/failure feedback
- **Autopilot status line** in Create tab — shows "Drawing from N curated articles · Last refreshed [time]" or "No curated articles available · Will search the web" below the autopilot button
- **Feed source info in results** — when autopilot or "Generate Post From This" uses a feed article, shows "Based on: [linked title] / via [feed name] · Relevance: [score]" above the drafts
- Empty states for no articles ("Click Refresh Feeds to scan your curated sources") and no matching filters ("Try broadening your search")
- `feed_react` category tag styling in CSS
- Feed category tag colors for all 10 categories (leadership, careers, executive_careers, hr_recruiting, labor_data, linkedin, hr_tech, compensation, workplace, business_news)

### Changed

## [1.4.0] - 2026-03-13

### Added
- **Feed-powered autopilot** — "Generate an idea for me" now draws from the curated RSS feed pool instead of relying on web search. Picks the highest-scoring unused article and generates 3 drafts reacting to it with Dana's expertise.
- `prompts/feed_react.md` — new prompt for generating LinkedIn posts from RSS article titles and summaries. Posts stand alone, cite data naturally, and narrow general trends to Dana's executive niche.
- `generate_from_feed_article(article)` in engine.py — generates 3 post drafts from a feed article dict using the base voice profile + feed reaction prompt
- `generate_autopilot_from_feeds()` in engine.py — upgraded autopilot flow: tries high-relevance articles (score >= 0.7) first, falls back to medium-relevance (>= 0.5), then falls back to web search
- `POST /api/articles/<id>/generate` — one-click content generation from a specific feed article. Saves insight, marks article as used, returns standard draft response.
- `feed_react` added as a valid insight category
- Autopilot API response now includes `method` field ("feed" or "web_search") and `source_article` object with article title, URL, feed name, relevance score, and relevance reason

### Changed
- `POST /api/generate/autopilot` now calls `generate_autopilot_from_feeds()` instead of `generate_autopilot()` directly. Response is a backward-compatible superset — existing fields (`success`, `insight_id`, `drafts`, `source_summary`, `source_url`) are preserved, with new `method` and `source_article` fields added.

## [1.3.0] - 2026-03-13

### Added
- **RSS Feed Scanner** — curated feed system that pulls articles from 12 high-quality career, leadership, HR, and labor market sources
- `feeds.py` with default feed list and category definitions covering leadership, careers, executive careers, HR/recruiting, labor data, HR tech, workplace, and business news
- `feed_scanner.py` module with feed fetching (via `requests` + `feedparser`), Claude-powered relevance scoring, and batch refresh

- Auto-refresh on startup — background thread checks feed freshness and refreshes if stale (>6 hours)
- Default feeds seeded automatically on first startup
- `feedparser>=6.0.0` and `requests>=2.31.0` added to requirements.txt

### Changed
- Feed fetcher uses `requests` with proper User-Agent header instead of feedparser's default HTTP client (fixes 403 blocks from BLS and other government/corporate sources)

### Fixed
- 11 of 16 original feed URLs were broken (404, 403, DNS failures, dead domains). Replaced with verified working alternatives:
  - HBR (404) replaced by McKinsey Insights
